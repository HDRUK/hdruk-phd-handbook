# About the Programme

This four-year programme in Health Data Science includes one year of foundational training followed by a three-year thesis project. Our underlying philosophy is that health data science requires a combination of expertise spanning three fundamental areas: statistical, computational and health sciences.

We recruit students whose academic background is in the quantitative disciplines, and train them to operate as members of multi-disciplinary teams with each member an expert in one of the fundamental areas but conversant in all three.

Students on the programme are registered at one of seven partner universities but can also draw on academic expertise from across the UK-wide HDRUK and Turing 
network of more than 20 universities.
Each student is supervised by a quantitative methods and a substantive health research expert. Co-funded projects with non-academic partners include a third supervisor drawn from the partner organisation.

Training events are hosted by the partner universities. These include short courses and  "immersions"  that we have designed with the twin aims of: expanding the studentsâ€™ skills base in preparation for their thesis work in years two to four;  encouraging UK-wide networking, both within the student cohort and with other, like-minded students at our partner universities.
