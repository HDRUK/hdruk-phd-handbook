# HDRUK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science

> “This PhD programme is a big step forward in our ambition to meet the UK’s need for trained health data scientists.”  
> -- <cite>Professor Peter Diggle, Programme Director</cite>

> “Embedding our PhD students within an extensive cross-sector, multi-disciplinary collaborative network will enable them to address the greatest challenges in implementing health data science at scale.”      
> -- <cite>Professor Christopher Yau, Programme Co-Director</cite>

Our PhD programme aims to develop future leaders in health data science. Its underlying philosophy is that health data science requires a combination of expertise spanning three fundamental areas: statistical, computational and health sciences.

HDR UK and the Alan Turing Institute, with the support of Wellcome, have brought together a UK-wide network of seven partner universities to deliver a unique PhD programme that champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better.
This unique programme combines the expertise of two national institutes: Health Data Research UK (Health Data Science) and The Alan Turing Institute (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). It is funded by Wellcome and champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better.
