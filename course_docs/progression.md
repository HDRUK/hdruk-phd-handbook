# Progression

## Programme Requirements

Progression through this PhD programme involves a mixture of milestones set by both this Programme and your Home University.

We expect all our students to:

1. Engage actively and constructively in all aspects of the training programme,
2. Develop and conduct an approved research plan to obtain your PhD qualification.

At the end of Year One, each student will have an **interview** with the Programme Directors and members of the Executive Board. We will discuss your engagement and contribution to the Year One Training Programme (via your [Evidence-based Training Record](programme/year1.md)) and the contents of your proposed research plan for Years 2-4. 

The outcome will be one of the following (note that all interviw outcomes are also conditional on home university requirements also being fulfilled):

- **Approved**: the student may progress to Year 2 of the PhD programme.
- **Request for Revision**: the student has engaged well with the training programme but is required to revise their PhD research plan and resubmit for review.
- **Request for New Research Plan**: the student has engaged well with the training programme but is required to devise a new PhD research plan and resubmit for review.
- **Cause for Concern**: the interview panel has identified issues related to your engagement with the PhD programme and will advise a further consultation with yourself and your home university to determine the next steps.

Cause for concern may arise due to factors such as unexplained or unauthorised absence, failure to participate in training activities, poor conduct when engaging with other students or staff. It could lead to the termination of your studentship. If at any stage of your PhD, you face personal or professional circumstances requiring extra support, please see the [Student Support](support.md) area for ways to find help.



In Years 2-4, the PhD programme will continue to request regular reports of your progress but would normally defer formal progression requirements to your home university.

## Home University Requirements

Your home university will outline its own PhD progression requirements. Most universities have annual progression milestones that must be met. You will need to satisfy these requirements in order to maintain your place on this PhD programme.
