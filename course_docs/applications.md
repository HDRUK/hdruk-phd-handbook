# Applying for the Programme

## Who are we looking for?

We’re looking for students who want to make a difference. People who want to work together to combine statistics and computation skills within a health setting to overcome existing challenges and look to develop new opportunities.

You will develop your background in quantitative science (e.g. maths, statistics, physics, engineering) and learn new skills within the field.

## How you will be supported

The programme offers the following to students:

- Tax-free student stipend (indicative Year 1 rates for 2020/21 of £19,919 for those based outside London and £22,278 for those based in London with increases each year).
- PhD registration fees at the UK student rate (and college fees where required)
- Research expenses and travel costs
