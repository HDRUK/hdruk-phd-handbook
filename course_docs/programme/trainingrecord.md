# Year 1 Training and Personal Development

During Year 1 of the Programme, you will maintain an evidence-based training record. This is to help you document your personal development in terms of the skills, knowledge and competencies relevant to health data science. This training record will be examined at the end of year progression interview so you are advised to keep it up-to-date and make logging your training a routine part of your work. You can use any appropriate medium you wish for recording this information (e.g. a Word document) but we hope that you will consider other approaches (e.g. a blog, website, instagram stories) as well. The example you set will likely influence future cohorts!

## Self-evaluation

At the start of the year, you will undertake a self-evaluation checklist exercise by examining the Common Core descriptions and determining which skills and competencies you already possessed and which you have less or no familiarity with. 

**Example Self-Evaluation Checklist**

We have not prescribed a specific form for the checklist. *Be Creative*. However, each is an example of the type of information you will want to record.

| Common Core Area        | Skill/Competency           | Capability  |
| ------------- |----------| -------------| 
| Computing      | Programming | I can program in R and Python with high-proficiency. |
| ------------- |----------| -------------| 
| Computing      | Software Development and Version Control | I have no experience of using Github or any other version control software. | 
| ------------- |----------| -------------| 
| Probability & Statistics      | Bayesian Statistics | I have not studied Bayesian Statistics before. | 
| ------------- |----------| -------------| 
| Probability & Statistics      | Likelihood-based inference | I have studied likelihood-based inference during my undergraduate degree but I have no practical experience of applying it. | 

## Training Record

During Year 1, we want you to reflect and record your thoughts about the training you have received. WAgain, we do not wish to be prescriptive about what the form of the training record takes, but the following example shows the type of information you might wish to record.

**Example Training Record**

| Common Core Area        | Skill/Competency           | Training   | Date |
| ------------- |----------| -------------| -------------| 
| Computing      | Programming | I have learnt how to use PyTorch following the Machine Learning course and applied it to a small data set. | 01/11/20 | 
| ------------- |----------| -------------| -------------| 
| Computing      | Software Development and Version Control | I was introduced to the use of Github as part of the Turing course and have been routinely using it to store my code updates for the covid-19 project. | 15 October 2020 | 
| ------------- |----------| -------------| -------------| 
| Probability & Statistics      | Bayesian Statistics | I have studied Bayesian Statistics as part of my pre-reading for the ML course. I will now attempt to incorporate it as part of my covid-19 project work. | 30 October 2020 |
| ------------- |----------| -------------| -------------|  
| Probability & Statistics      | Likelihood-based inference | Peter Diggle gave a lecture on  likelihood-based inference. I read about likelihood-based inference for GLMs to understand how to perform ordinal regression for the risk prediction workshop. | 7 October 2020 | 
| ------------- |----------| -------------| -------------| 
| Ethics      | GDPR  | Attended training seminar on GDPR at home university. | 17 December 2020 |
