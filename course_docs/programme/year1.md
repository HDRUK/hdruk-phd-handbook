## Remote meetings

All training events during October to December 2020 will be run remotely, using Zoom. We are hoping to be able to run some residential training events during
the first half of 2021, depending on the progress of the Covid-19 epidemic. At all times, we will follow the current regulations and advice to ensure the safety of 
all participants.

## Induction

The two-day induction meeting 28 and 29 September 2020 is an opportunity for all programme staff and students to meet each other, albeit virtually. It will cover 
a range of scientific and administrative matters, including overviews of HDRUK's priority research themes and data-resources, and how to make the most of 
students' opportunities to connect with like-minded students, across the programme and on other programmes within their home unversities.

## Common Core

The **Common Core** is a syllabus that consists of key knowledge, skills and competencies that we believe should be part of the repertoire of expertise for all health data scientists. 

It is split into six components whose detailed descriptions are given in [Courses](courses.md):

	1. Computing
	2. Probability & Statistics
	3. Biology
	4. Reproducible Research
	5. Ethics
	6. Team Science and Communication 

At the start of the course, each student will complete a [self-evaluation checklist](trainingrecord) to measure their existing competencies against the Common Core. Some students will have extensive prior experience in some areas, but maybe little to none in others. The Common Core is intended to help students to identify their personal needs for training and development.

During the first year, students will continually update an [evidence-based training record](trainingrecord) where they will map the activities contained in the various training courses to the Common Core. The intention is for each student to reflect on the training provided and to understand how their experiences align with the Common Core. This is not intended to be a "tick box" exercise. The training record will form part of the progress review at the end of Year 1.

## Immersions 

The aim of immersions, which typically cover several days of intensive work, is to provide students with a deep insight to research activities at each of our university partners and how these align with HDRUK's national health data science research priorities. Each immersion will contain technical training and cohort building activities. We hope students will use the immersions to develop ideas for cross-site PhD research projects in Years 2-4.

## Mini-projects

Students will undertake two mini-projects to develop their experience of working on substantive health science projects whose solutions require the application of advanced quantitative methods. The Covid-19 Challenge project will occupy roughly half of each student's time from November 2020 to January 2021 inclusive, after which we will organise an event  at which students can present their findings to the wider group. Each project will be supervised by a member of the programme staff and the data-owner.
