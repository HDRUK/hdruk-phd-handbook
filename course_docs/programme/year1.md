## Common Core

The **Common Core** is a syllabus that consists of key knowledge, skills and competencies that we believe should be part of the repertoire of expertise for all health data scientists. 

It is split into six components with detailed outlines are given in [Courses](courses.md):

	1. Computing
	2. Probability & Statistics
	3. Biology
	4. Reproducible Research
	5. Ethics
	6. Team Science and Communication 

At the start of the course, each student will complete a [self-evaluation checklist](dummy.md) to measure their existing competencies against the Common Core. Some students will have extensive prior experience in some areas, but maybe little to none in others. We established the Common Core as a means to support students to identify their unique needs for training and development.

During the first year, students will continually update an [evidence-based training record](dummy.md) where they will map the activities contained in the various training courses to the Common Core. The intention is for each student to reflect on the training provided and to understand how their experiences align with the Common Core. This is not intended to be a "tick box" exercise. The training record will form part of the progress review at the end of Year 1.

## Immersion Weeks 

The aim of immersion weeks is to provide students with a deep insight to research activities occurring at each of our university partners and how these align with the national health data science priorities of HDRUK. Each immersion week will contain technical training and cohort building activities. We hope students will use these immersion weeks to develop ideas for cross-site PhD research projects in Years 2-4.
