# Introduction to Biology

**Organisers:** 

- Christopher Yau
- Catalina Vallejos

## Overview

This course is intended to support you to:

- learn some fundamental biological ideas and concepts,
- understand the importance of biological underpinnings in human disease study, 
- encourage interest in pursuing these topics as part of your PhD study.

## Schedule

### Lectures

Students will initially follow a series of online, introductory lectures on the following topics:

1. Introduction to Cell and Molecular Biology
2. Introduction to Genomics
3. Introduction to the NHS and Health Systems

### Presentation Task

**Themes**

Following this, the cohort will split into two groups and each will focus on a biological topic:

- **Phenome-wide association studies** (PheWAS)
	* What is a "single nucleotide polymorphism"? What other types of genetic variant exist?
	* What is a "phenotype"? How does this relate to electronic health (medical) records?
	* What is a genetic association study? 
	* How can a PheWAS be used to determine the potential genetic underpinning of human disease? What are the advantages over a conventional genetic association study?

- **Single cell 'omics**
	* What are the advantages of single cell biology over measurements taken over a group of cells?
	* What types of measurements can be taken on individual cells? How do they differ in terms of what they tell us about the biology of the cell?
	* What biological processes or systems can be better explored using single cell techniques?
	* What are the challenges of working with single cells?


**Aims and Expectations**

The aim is for each group to research and develop an oral presentation on your allocated topic describing:

- the key biological concepts, 
- example biological experiments and 
- the mechanisms underlying the data generated and how these data can be analysed to give insights.

These presentations should be *introductory* in style. You are aiming to teach the other group about your topic.

We are not expecting these presentations to be expert talks. Many terms and ideas will be unfamiliar to you. You do *not* need to understand everything only enough to create an interesting but factual presentation.

This exercise principally concerns the biology so there is no need to investigate or research the details of the data analytics associated with these topics. No data analysis or computational work is required.


**What you need to do**

Each presentation will be 40 minutes long and each member of your group will speak for *at least* 10 minutes. 

You will need to produce slides for your presentation.

You can search for and identify source materials to learn about these topics (some suggestions given below) that range from the very elementary to cutting edge research articles.

Initially, your group should discuss and understand each others underpinning knowledge on your allocated topic (if any exists at all). You will then need to determine the sub-themes you wish to discuss in your presentation (suggestions are given above) and allocate tasks for individuals to research and write presentation materials on these sub-themes.  


** Group Organisation ** 

You will be working to learn and absorb new information and material *rapidly*. Recognise that each group member will have a different academic background and that you will all have something new to learn but it will not necessarily be on the same topic. Share any knowledge you have and don't be afraid to speak out if there is something you are unfamiliar with. It is important that within your group you ensure that *all* members of the group remain engaged and actively contribute.
