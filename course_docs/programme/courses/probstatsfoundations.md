# Foundations of Probability and Statistics

**Organisers:** 

- Peter Diggle

## Overview

This course  aims to introduce students to the role of statistics in scientific research, and to the fundamental results in probability that provide the theoretical basis of many statistical methods used to analysis scientific data. The emphasis throughout will be on general concepts rather than specific techniques that can be learnt through a combination of directed reading and practical application.
The course will be delivered though a series of online lectures, follow-up tutorial discussions and suggestions for practical work that students can complete in their own time.

## Syllabus

1.	Statistics and scientific method
	- Investigating Newtonâ€™s law; inference - estimation, testing, prediction
2.	Experimental design and analysis
	- Systematic and random variation; blocking, randomisation, controlling and adjusting; design and analysis of simple comparative experiments
3.	Probability
	- Laws of probability; conditional probability; Bayes Theorem; random variables; parametric families of probability distributions
4.	Likelihood-based inference 
	- Inferential questions; populations and samples; statistical and clinical significance; the likelihood function; properties of MLEs and GLRTs; Bayesian parametric inference; Monte Carlo methods
5.	Dependent data
	- From random variables to stochastic processes; case-study on disease prevalence mapping
