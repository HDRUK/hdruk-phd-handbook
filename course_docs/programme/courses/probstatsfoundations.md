# Foundations of Probability and Statistics

**Organisers:** 

- Peter Diggle

## Overview

The aims of this course are to introduce students to the role of statistics in scientific research, and to the fundamental results in probability that provide the theoretical basis of many statistical methods used to analysis scientific data. The emphasis throughout will be on general concepts rather than specific techniques that can be learnt through a combination of directed reading and practical application.

The course will be delivered thoughr a series of four online lectures, follow-up tutorial discussions and suggestions for practical work that students can complete in their own time.
