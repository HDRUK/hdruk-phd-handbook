# Machine Learning Design

**Organisers:** 

- Christopher Yau

## Overview

The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the principles of design and how they apply to the development of machine learning solutions for health data science. During this course we will consider the different phases of generic "design process" theory and how they can be applied in health data science. The aim is to provide new ideas that will help to maximise your creativity during your PhD but also boost your critical evaluation skills to enable you to recognise how to judge "good" from "bad" solutions.

## Syllabus

1. Problem identification: 
	- to consider the extraction of mathematical problems from real-world problem descriptions
	- to recognise sources of bias when understanding problems

2. Problem specification
	- to consider approaches for identifying and specifying problem and solution constraints
	- to recognise the need to develop benchmark and evaluation criteria

3. Solution generation
	- to understand the different dimensions of the "creative" phase of solution design
	- to learn about techniques that aim to broaden the variety of plausible solutions

4. Solution evaluation
	- to recognise the need for evidence-driven evaluation of solutions
	- to understand the critical role of evaluation throughout the design process and not the end

5. Solution implementation
	- to understand the challenges of implementing solutions in the real-world and wider considerations of the health care service
