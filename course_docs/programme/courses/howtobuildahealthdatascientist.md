# How to Build a Health Data Scientist

**Organisers:** 

- Christopher Yau

## Overview

This is a cohort exercise for year one students to construct your own “living” training syllabus for health data science.

You will consider the following six “core” areas:

Common Core Areas:
 
1. Computing
2. Probability & Statistics
3. Biology
4. Reproducible Research
5. Ethics
6. Team Science and Communication 

This syllabus will evolve over your first year as you encounter new experiences that will allow you to reinforce or update your expectations and beliefs. We want your “actual” training experiences with us to form a training framework for future cohorts and inform training initiatives across HDRUK and more widely both nationally and internationally. 

## Things to consider

1. What high-level competencies should we place under each area?
2. What specific skills or knowledge should a health data scientist really know?
3. Which of these are relevant for doctoral researchers?
4. What particular requirements are there for health and medical sciences?
5. What is the personal or external evidence base for your choices?
6. At the end of your PhD, where do you want to be?

## Milestones 

There will be four major milestones (and approximate timelines):

1. **First draft of syllabus** plus group presentation [Y1, End of October]
2. **First revision.** “What has changed after three months of project work?” [Y1, January]
3. **Second revision.** “End of Year Reflections” [Y1, May/June]
4. **Publication.** “We are the HDRUK-Turing PhD students ...” [Y1, September]

Working materials will be stored on a shared Google documents. Final publication will be prepared with the support of the HDRUK Training Group.
