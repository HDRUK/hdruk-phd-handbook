# HDRUK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science

> “This PhD programme is a big step forward in our ambition to meet the UK’s need for trained health data scientists.”  
> -- <cite>Professor Peter Diggle, Programme Director</cite>

Our PhD programme aims to develop future leaders in health data science. Its underlying philosophy is that health data science requires a combination of expertise spanning three fundamental areas: statistical, computational and health sciences.

HDR UK and the Alan Turing Institute, with the support of Wellcome, have brought together a UK-wide network of seven partner universities to deliver a unique PhD programme that champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better.
