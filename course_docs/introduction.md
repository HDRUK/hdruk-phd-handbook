# HDRUK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science

> “This PhD programme is a big step forward in our ambition to meet the UK’s need for trained health data scientists.”  
> -- <cite>Professor Peter Diggle, Programme Director</cite>

> “Embedding our PhD students within an extensive cross-sector, multi-disciplinary collaborative network will enable them to address the greatest challenges in implementing health data science at scale.”      
> -- <cite>Professor Christopher Yau, Programme Co-Director</cite>

We are excited to welcome you to the start of your doctoral studies with us at [Health Data Research UK](http://www.hdruk.ac.uk) in 
partnership with the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). This partnership brings to the Programme the combined
expertise of two national institutes: Health Data Research UK (Health Data Science) and 
The Alan Turing Institute (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). It is funded by the  [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/) and champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better.

In addition to our roles as Programme Director and Co-Director, we hold academic posts at
[Lancaster University](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/) (Peter) 
and at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) (Chris) and are looking forward to being involved in the delivery, 
as well as the leadership, of this PhD Programme. We
are ably assisted in both of these roles by an Executive Committee that includes at least one academic lead from each of the seven universities at
which students on the Programme can initially register for their doctoral studies - [Queen's Belfast](https://www.qub.ac.uk/), 
[Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/), [Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), [Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), 
[Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/),[Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). 

Each of you is both a member of the HDRUK/Turing Wellcome PhD Programme and a research student at your university. What this
will mean in practice is somthing we will discover together in the months ahead. My hope and expectation is that each of you will
benefit from being a member of two distinct but overlapping cohorts.

Over the four years of your studies you will spend progressively less time on Programme-wide activities and 
correspondingly more
time working in your respective universities on your thesis projects. 

You will spend most of your first
year engaging in Programme-organised activities. As well as sharpening and adding to your personal took-kit, these
will give you opportunities to meet
(if only virtually in the early months) and share ideas with
your fellow-students and potential thesis co-supervisors from around the UK. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this. 
Fundamental to Chris's and my philosophy is that the best health data science is team science, with team members spanning multiple
disciplines. We expect this to be reflected in the supervisory teams for your thesis projects and to encourage this
you will be able to visit, and be co-supervised by, researchers in other universities to give you the best possible
supervisory team for your thesis work. Your university will also be organising activities for you during your first year, the nature of which will vary across 
the seven universites. 

 In your second, third and fourth years, we will
continue to organise Programme-based training events, including student-led events, but the schedule of events
will be much less intensive than in your first year, as you will spend the bulk of your time on your thesis project
