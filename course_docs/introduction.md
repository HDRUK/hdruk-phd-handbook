# HDRUK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science

> “This PhD programme is a big step forward in our ambition to meet the UK’s need for trained health data scientists.”  
> -- <cite>Professor Peter Diggle, Programme Director</cite>

Our PhD programme aims to develop future leaders in health data science. Its underlying philosophy is that health data science requires a combination of expertise spanning three fundamental areas: statistical, computational and health sciences.

This unique programme combines the expertise of two national institutes: Health Data Research UK (Health Data Science) and The Alan Turing Institute (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). It is funded by Wellcome and champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better.

On this PhD programme, students will be registered to obtain their doctoral qualification from one of our seven UK university partners which are drawn from the Health Data Research UK and the Turing network. 

> “Embedding our PhD students within an extensive cross-sector, multi-disciplinary collaborative network will enable them to address the greatest challenges in implementing health data science at scale.”      
> -- <cite>Professor Christopher Yau, Programme Co-Director</cite>
