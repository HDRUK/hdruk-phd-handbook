# Resources

## Data & Training

HDRUK and Turing are national institutes with a large partnership networks and strategic leadership over many areas of national data science developments. Our programme will support you to make use of our unique capabilities and connections where relevant to your training and research.

Potential data and training resources include:

- [HDRUK Events](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/news-and-events/?_post_type=events)
- [Turing Events](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events)
- [Health Data Research Innovation Gateway](https://www.healthdatagateway.org/)
- [Turing Way](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/turing-way-handbook-reproducible-data-science)
- [APTS](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/apts/)

## Computation

### Secure Data Platforms

HDRUK does not possess substantive research computing resources within the organisation. However, the projects and research infrastructure that it funds and supports will often embed computational resource. These will typically be linked to health data sources which are held within safe environments (e.g. Data Safe Havens, Trusted Research Environments, etc). The computational assets relevant to the analysis of these datasets will lie with those who host and managed the data. Please when designing an analysis using secure data assets, you should do so with the available compute infrastructure in mind. These can range from state-of-the-art cloud-based through to a standalone, aged Windows server running behind an NHS firewall!

### Host University

Research that does not involve the use of secure health data can be supported via your host university resources. Many of your universities offer “free at the point of use” access to high-performance computing either at the departmental or university level. Enquire locally or with your EB representative to make use of these resources.

### Obtaining more compute support

Where these host university facilities are insufficient for your needs, your Studentship provides substantial financial assets to allow you to acquire additional computational capabilities. These can be made by written request to the Programme Directors with the support of your research supervision team. You must provide a case for support to justify the requirements. 

**Note - we do not foresee Year 1 students requiring this facility.** 

The programme will support all reasonable requests for computational spend where these genuinely contribute to your PhD research. 

**Examples of inappropriate requests might include:** 

- stockpiling of high-performance computing credits without a definite use plan, 
- purchase of computational assets that will be shared with others in your research environment without a mechanism to guarantee you exclusive use, 
- high-cost visualisation equipment (e.g. extra large high-definition monitors, VR headsets) without a explicit research use.
