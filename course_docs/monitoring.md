# Feedback, monitoring, assessment

## Directors Meetings

In Year 1, you will meet individually with the programme directors on at least three occasions to discuss and chart your progress. These meetings will occur at the beginning of the programme, at around six months and at the end of the year. There will be an annual meeting in Years 2-4. 

At the start of the programme you will be asked to outline your personal expectations and ambitions. We hope to support you in realising those goals and to modify them as your experience and interests change over time.
