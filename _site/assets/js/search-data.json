    "content": "Background . History . In 2019, Health Data Research UK (HDRUK) and the Alan Turing Institute (Turing) decided to combined forces to submit an ambitious application for a PhD Programme in Health Data Science to the Wellcome Trust led by Professors Peter Diggle and Christopher Yau. . Our aim was to create a unique national PhD programme, formed from a distributed network of students based across an HDRUK/Turing university partnership network, which adheres to HDRUK’s “One Institute” strategy which aims to unite the UK’s health data to enable discoveries that improve people’s lives. We believe that collaborations and partnerships are vital to ensuring that health data is used effectively and this is a philosophy that we will instill in our PhD cohorts. . After a rigourous assessment by an international panel, our application was accepted for funding and we began our first recruitment for PhD students at the end of 2019. . University Partners . Our programme is delivered in collaboration with seven university partners: . Queen’s University Belfast | University of Birmingham | University of Cambridge | University of Edinburgh | University of Oxford | University of Manchester | University College London | . Students will be registered at one of our partner universities during their studies and all students will undertake training courses and activities delivered by each university. .",

The purpose of this course is to provide students with an overview of the cutting edge ideas in modern machine learning with a focus on probabilistic approaches based on Bayesian methodology. This course is not intended to teach you Bayesian modelling in its entirety in these eight sessions. Instead, we will focus on providing a platform to support further detailed learning in your own time by reviewing key aspects of the field and how they apply in health applications and examining the potential developments that may require your attentions. .

The aims of this course are to introduce students to the role of statistics in scientific research, and to the fundamental results in probability that provide the theoretical basis of many statistical methods used to analysis scientific data. The emphasis throughout will be on general concepts rather than specific techniques that can be learnt through a combination of directed reading and practical application. The course will be delivered thoughr a series of four online lectures, follow-up tutorial discussions and suggestions for practical work that students can complete in their own time. . Syllabus .

    "content": "Student Support . Your welfare during your PhD is of the utmost importance to us and you will have access to two main forms of independent support as a student on this programme. . Support from your University . Year 1 . All our first year students will be registered with a member of our Executive Board at your home university. You should have been informed of who this is either by your home university or by us. They will act as your Graduate Tutor/Supervisor in Year 1 of the programme and provide support during the first year of the programme. Please note that this is not the same as your PhD Research Supervisor(s) who will not be chosen until the end of Year 1. Your home university may also allocate other academic staff to support you during your PhD studies. . Your home university should provide you with information detailing their institutional student welfare support provisions during your induction or at some point during your first year of study. If you do not feel you have been advised of this information then please contact your home university graduate tutor in the first instance. . Years 2-4 . After you have chosen your main PhD research topic and supervisory team at the end of Year 1, your academic support will normally transfer from your Year 1 graduate tutor to the lead research supervisor and any additional members of the supervisory team as appropriate. They will often be your first destination for further support but where applicable you may wish to use other home university resources and services. Please consult your home university student services for details. . Support from us . Our students will also uniquely have support external to their university via the programme. This could be members of the Programme Operations Team or members of the Executive Board not at your University. . The Directors . The Programme Directors should be advised if you are experiencing any difficulties with your studies either because of challenges presented by your working environment or in your personal life. We will provide support to help you overcome any challenges where your home university cannot provide this. . Programme Administration . The Programme Administration team should be advised if you are experiencing any difficulties with your studies because of administrative problems. Examples might include financial issues with payments of fees or stipends, visa issues for international students, official student documentation, etc. If you are sick or unable to attend planned training activities, the Administration team should be informed in the first instance. . Executive Board . Our Executive Board consists of highly experienced academics with a wide range of experience across a number of scientific and non-scientific disciplines. Our students are welcome to draw upon these experiences where they require subject- or discipline-specific advice in relation to their research studies or professional development. However, issues which are personal in nature or not research specific should first be directed to the Programme Directors. . All information will be treated strictly confidentiality unless you tell us otherwise . Other support . Harassment . HDRUK takes a zero-tolerance policy towards harassment. Details of our policy can be found here. . Disability . HDRUK aims to make our PhD programme as accessible as possible for those with disabilities. Our policy for those living with disabilities is here. . Childcare . HDRUK aims to support student parents. Our policy for those with childcare responsibilities is here. .",
