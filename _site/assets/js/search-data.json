    "title": "HDRUK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science",
    "content": "“This PhD programme is a big step forward in our ambition to meet the UK’s need for trained health data scientists.” – Professor Peter Diggle, Programme Director . “Embedding our PhD students within an extensive cross-sector, multi-disciplinary collaborative network will enable them to address the greatest challenges in implementing health data science at scale.” – Professor Christopher Yau, Programme Co-Director . We are excited to welcome you to the start of your doctoral studies with us at Health Data Research UK in partnership with the Alan Turing Institute. This partnership brings to the Programme the combined expertise of two national institutes: Health Data Research UK (Health Data Science) and The Alan Turing Institute (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). It is funded by the Wellcome Trust and champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better. In addition to our roles as Programme Director and Co-Director, we hold academic posts at Lancaster University (Peter) and at the University of Manchester (Chris) and are looking forward to being involved in the delivery, as well as the leadership, of this PhD Programme. We are ably assisted in both of these roles by an Executive Committee that includes at least one academic lead from each of the seven universities at which students on the Programme can initially register for their doctoral studies - Queen’s Belfast, Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford, University College London. Each of you is both a member of the HDRUK/Turing Wellcome PhD Programme and a research student at your university. What this will mean in practice is somthing we will discover together in the months ahead. My hope and expectation is that each of you will benefit from being a member of two distinct but overlapping cohorts. Over the four years of your studies you will spend progressively less time on Programme-wide activities and correspondingly more time working in your respective universities on your thesis projects. You will spend most of your first year engaging in Programme-organised activities. As well as sharpening and adding to your personal took-kit, these will give you opportunities to meet (if only virtually in the early months) and share ideas with your fellow-students and potential thesis co-supervisors from around the UK. We cannot over-emphasise the importance of this. Fundamental to our philosophy is that the best health data science is team science, with team members spanning multiple disciplines. We expect this to be reflected in the supervisory teams for your thesis projects and to encourage this you will be able to visit, and be co-supervised by, researchers in other universities to give you the best possible supervisory team for your thesis work. Your university will also be organising activities for you during your first year, the nature of which will vary across the seven universites. In your second, third and fourth years, we will continue to organise Programme-based training events, including student-led events, but the schedule of events will be much less intensive than in your first year, as you will spend the bulk of your time on your thesis project .

At the end of Year One, each student will have an interview with the Programme Directors and members of the Executive Board. We will discuss your engagement and contribution to the Year One Training Programme (via your Evidence-based Training Record) and the contents of your proposed research plan for Years 2-4. The outcome will be one of the following (note that all interview outcomes are conditional on home university requirements also being fulfilled): . | Approved: the student may progress to Year 2 of the PhD programme. | Request for Revision: the student has engaged well with the training programme but is required to revise their PhD research plan and resubmit for review. | Request for New Research Plan: the student has engaged well with the training programme but is required to devise a new PhD research plan and resubmit for review. | Cause for Concern: the interview panel has identified issues related to your engagement with the PhD programme and will advise a further consultation with yourself and your home university to determine the next steps. | . Cause for concern may arise due to factors such as unexplained or unauthorised absence, failure to participate in training activities, poor conduct when engaging with other students or staff. In exceptional circumstances, it could lead to the termination of your studentship. If at any stage of your PhD, you face personal or professional circumstances requiring extra support, please see the Student Support area for ways to find help.

However, the projects and research infrastructure that it funds and supports will often embed computational resource. These will typically be linked to health data sources which are held within safe environments (e.g. Data Safe Havens, Trusted Research Environments, etc). The computational assets relevant to the analysis of these datasets will lie with those who host and managed the data. Please when designing an analysis using secure data assets, you should do so with the available compute infrastructure in mind. These can range from state-of-the-art cloud-based through to a standalone, aged Windows server running behind an NHS firewall! . Host University . Research that does not involve the use of secure health data can be supported via your host university resources. Many of your universities offer “free at the point of use” access to high-performance computing either at the departmental or university level. Enquire locally or with your EB representative to make use of these resources. Obtaining more compute support . Where these host university facilities are insufficient for your needs, your Studentship provides substantial financial assets to allow you to acquire additional computational capabilities. These can be made by written request to the Programme Directors with the support of your research supervision team. You must provide a case for support to justify the requirements. Note - we do not foresee Year 1 students requiring this facility. The programme will support all reasonable requests for computational spend where these genuinely contribute to your PhD research. Examples of inappropriate requests might include: . | stockpiling of high-performance computing credits without a definite use plan, | purchase of computational assets that will be shared with others in your research environment without a mechanism to guarantee you exclusive use, | high-cost visualisation equipment (e.g. extra large high-definition monitors, VR headsets) without a explicit research use. | .
