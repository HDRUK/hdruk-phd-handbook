    "content": "Background . History . In 2019, Health Data Research UK (HDRUK) and the Alan Turing Institute (Turing) decided to combined forces to submit an ambitious application for a PhD Programme in Health Data Science to the Wellcome Trust led by Professors Peter Diggle and Christopher Yau. . Our aim was to create a unique national PhD programme, formed from a distributed network of students based across an HDRUK/Turing university partnership network, which adheres to HDRUK’s “One Institute” strategy which aims to unite the UK’s health data to enable discoveries that improve people’s lives. We believe that collaborations and partnerships are vital to ensuring that health data is used effectively and this is a philosophy that we will instill in our PhD cohorts. . After a rigourous assessment by an international panel, our application was accepted for funding and we began our first recruitment for PhD students at the end of 2019. . University Partners . Our programme is delivered in collaboration with seven university partners: . Queen’s University Belfast | University of Birmingham | University of Cambridge | University of Edinburgh | University of Oxford | University of Manchester | University College London | . Students will be registered at one of our partner universities during their studies and all students will undertake training courses and activities delivered by each university. .",
