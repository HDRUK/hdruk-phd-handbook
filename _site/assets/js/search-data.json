Our aim was to create a unique national PhD programme, formed from a distributed network of students based across an HDRUK/Turing university partnership network, which adheres to HDRUK’s “One Institute” strategy which aims to unite the UK’s health data to enable discoveries that improve people’s lives. We believe that collaborations and partnerships are vital to ensuring that health data is used effectively and this is a philosophy that we will instill in our PhD cohorts. After a rigourous assessment by an international panel, our application was accepted for funding and we began our first recruitment for PhD students at the end of 2019. ",

You should have been informed of who this is either by your home university or by us. They will act as your Graduate Tutor/Supervisor in Year 1 of the programme and provide support during the first year of the programme. Please note that this is not the same as your PhD Research Supervisor(s) who will not be chosen until the end of Year 1. Your home university may also allocate other academic staff to support you during your PhD studies. Your home university should provide you with information detailing their institutional student welfare support provisions during your induction or at some point during your first year of study. If you do not feel you have been advised of this information then please contact your home university graduate tutor in the first instance. Years 2-4 . After you have chosen your main PhD research topic and supervisory team at the end of Year 1, your academic support will normally transfer from your Year 1 graduate tutor to the lead research supervisor and any additional members of the supervisory team as appropriate. They will often be your first destination for further support but where applicable you may wish to use other home university resources and services. Please consult your home university student services for details. ",

The Programme Directors should be advised if you are experiencing any difficulties with your studies either because of challenges presented by your working environment or in your personal life. We will provide support to help you overcome any challenges where your home university cannot provide this. Programme Administration . The Programme Administration team should be advised if you are experiencing any difficulties with your studies because of administrative problems. Examples might include financial issues with payments of fees or stipends, visa issues for international students, official student documentation, etc. If you are sick or unable to attend planned training activities, the Administration team should be informed in the first instance. Executive Board . Our Executive Board consists of highly experienced academics with a wide range of experience across a number of scientific and non-scientific disciplines. Our students are welcome to draw upon these experiences where they require subject- or discipline-specific advice in relation to their research studies or professional development. However, issues which are personal in nature or not research specific should first be directed to the Programme Directors.

Team Science and Communication . At the start of the course, each student will complete a self-evaluation checklist to measure their existing competencies against the Common Core. Some students will have extensive prior experience in some areas, but maybe little to none in others. We established the Common Core as a means to support students to identify their unique needs for training and development. During the first year, students will continually update an evidence-based training record where they will map the activities contained in the various training courses to the Common Core. The intention is for each student to reflect on the training provided and to understand how their experiences align with the Common Core. This is not intended to be a “tick box” exercise. The training record will form part of the progress review at the end of Year 1. ",
