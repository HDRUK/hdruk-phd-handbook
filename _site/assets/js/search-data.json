Our underlying philosophy is that health data science requires a combination of expertise spanning three fundamental areas: statistical, computational and health sciences. We recruit students whose academic background is in the quantitative disciplines, and train them to operate as members of multi-disciplinary teams with each member an expert in one of the fundamental areas but conversant in all three. Students on the programme are registered at one of seven partner universities but can also draw on academic expertise from across the HDRUK and Turing university network across the UK. Each student is supervised by a quantitative methods and a substantive health research expert. Co-funded projects with non-academic partners include a third supervisor drawn from the partner organisation. Training events are hosted by the partner universities. These include short courses and “immersions” courses that we have designed with the twin aims of expanding the students’ skills base in preparation for their thesis work in years two to four and encouraging UK-wide networking, both within the student cohort and with other, like-minded students at our partner universities.

    "content": "“This PhD programme is a big step forward in our ambition to meet the UK’s need for trained health data scientists.” – Professor Peter Diggle, Programme Director . Our PhD programme aims to develop future leaders in health data science. Its underlying philosophy is that health data science requires a combination of expertise spanning three fundamental areas: statistical, computational and health sciences. This unique programme combines the expertise of two national institutes: Health Data Research UK (Health Data Science) and The Alan Turing Institute (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). It is funded by Wellcome and champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better. On this PhD programme, students will be registered to obtain their doctoral qualification from one of our seven UK university partners which are drawn from the Health Data Research UK and the Turing network. “Embedding our PhD students within an extensive cross-sector, multi-disciplinary collaborative network will enable them to address the greatest challenges in implementing health data science at scale.” – Professor Christopher Yau, Programme Co-Director .

Some students will have extensive prior experience in some areas, but maybe little to none in others. We established the Common Core as a means to support students to identify their unique needs for training and development. During the first year, students will continually update an evidence-based training record where they will map the activities contained in the various training courses to the Common Core.
