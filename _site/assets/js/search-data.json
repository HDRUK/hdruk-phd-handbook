Our underlying philosophy is that health data science requires a combination of expertise spanning three fundamental areas: statistical, computational and health sciences. We recruit students whose academic background is in the quantitative disciplines, and train them to operate as members of multi-disciplinary teams with each member an expert in one of the fundamental areas but conversant in all three. Students on the programme are registered at one of seven partner universities but can also draw on academic expertise from across the UK-wide HDRUK and Turing network of more than 20 universities. Each student is supervised by a quantitative methods and a substantive health research expert. Co-funded projects with non-academic partners include a third supervisor drawn from the partner organisation. Training events are hosted by the partner universities. These include short courses and “immersions” that we have designed to meet two broad aims: expanding the students’ skills base in preparation for their thesis work in years two to four; encouraging UK-wide networking, both within the student cohort and with other, like-minded students at our partner universities.

    "title": "HDRUK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science",
    "content": "“This PhD programme is a big step forward in our ambition to meet the UK’s need for trained health data scientists.” – Professor Peter Diggle, Programme Director . “Embedding our PhD students within an extensive cross-sector, multi-disciplinary collaborative network will enable them to address the greatest challenges in implementing health data science at scale.” – Professor Christopher Yau, Programme Co-Director . We are excited to welcome you to the start of your doctoral studies with us at Health Data Research UK in partnership with the Alan Turing Institute. This partnership brings to the Programme the combined expertise of two national institutes: Health Data Research UK (Health Data Science) and The Alan Turing Institute (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). It is funded by the Wellcome Trust and champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better. In addition to our roles as Programme Director and Co-Director, we hold academic posts at Lancaster University (Peter) and at the University of Manchester (Chris) and are looking forward to being involved in the delivery, as well as the leadership, of this PhD Programme. We are ably assisted in both of these roles by an Executive Committee that includes at least one academic lead from each of the seven universities at which students on the Programme can initially register for their doctoral studies - Queen’s Belfast, Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford, University College London. Each of you is both a member of the HDRUK/Turing Wellcome PhD Programme and a research student at your university. What this will mean in practice is somthing we will discover together in the months ahead. My hope and expectation is that each of you will benefit from being a member of two distinct but overlapping cohorts. Over the four years of your studies you will spend progressively less time on Programme-wide activities and correspondingly more time working in your respective universities on your thesis projects. You will spend most of your first year engaging in Programme-organised activities. As well as sharpening and adding to your personal took-kit, these will give you opportunities to meet (if only virtually in the early months) and share ideas with your fellow-students and potential thesis co-supervisors from around the UK. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this. Fundamental to Chris’s and my philosophy is that the best health data science is team science, with team members spanning multiple disciplines. We expect this to be reflected in the supervisory teams for your thesis projects and to encourage this you will be able to visit, and be co-supervised by, researchers in other universities to give you the best possible supervisory team for your thesis work. Your university will also be organising activities for you during your first year, the nature of which will vary across the seven universites. In your second, third and fourth years, we will continue to organise Programme-based training events, including student-led events, but the schedule of events will be much less intensive than in your first year, as you will spend the bulk of your time on your thesis project .

We will discuss your engagement and contribution to the Year One Training Programme (via your Evidence-based Training Record) and the contents of your proposed research plan for Years 2-4. The outcome will be one of the following (note that all interviw outcomes are also conditional on home university requirements also being fulfilled): . | Approved: the student may progress to Year 2 of the PhD programme. | Request for Revision: the student has engaged well with the training programme but is required to revise their PhD research plan and resubmit for review. | Request for New Research Plan: the student has engaged well with the training programme but is required to devise a new PhD research plan and resubmit for review. | Cause for Concern: the interview panel has identified issues related to your engagement with the PhD programme and will advise a further consultation with yourself and your home university to determine the next steps. | . Cause for concern may arise due to factors such as unexplained or unauthorised absence, failure to participate in training activities, poor conduct when engaging with other students or staff.

Our PhD programme aims to develop future leaders in health data science. Its underlying philosophy is that health data science requires a combination of expertise spanning three fundamental areas: statistical, computational and health sciences. HDR UK and the Alan Turing Institute, with the support of Wellcome, have brought together a UK-wide network of seven partner universities to deliver a unique PhD programme that champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better. This unique programme combines the expertise of two national institutes: Health Data Research UK (Health Data Science) and The Alan Turing Institute (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). It is funded by Wellcome and champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better. Link: See our partners . On this PhD programme, students will be registered to obtain their doctoral qualification from one of our seven UK university partners which are drawn from the Health Data Research UK and the Turing network.

Team Science and Communication . At the start of the course, each student will complete a self-evaluation checklist to measure their existing competencies against the Common Core. Some students will have extensive prior experience in some areas, but maybe little to none in others. The Common Core is intended to help students to identify their personal needs for training and development. During the first year, students will continually update an evidence-based training record where they will map the activities contained in the various training courses to the Common Core. The intention is for each student to reflect on the training provided and to understand how their experiences align with the Common Core. This is not intended to be a “tick box” exercise. The training record will form part of the progress review at the end of Year 1. ",

The formal process for approving a thesis topic is that potential supervisory teams will submit PhD proposals to the Exective Board, but we would like students to be pro-active in contacting potential supervisors to discuss a possible match between their and the supervisors’ interests. Each proposal should: address a substantive scientific problem and involve a strong computational and statistical component; give a detailed description for any project-specific training needs; describe how the project will develop the student’s team science skills; include a publication plan that gives students the opportunity to publish methodological work in advance of their project’s substantive findings. Through this process, We expect each student to have identified their PhD research topic and supervisory team by late June 2020, and for their supervisory team to include both a quantitative methods expert and a substantive health science expert. Industry co-funded projects will include a third supervisor drawn from the co-funding organisation. ",
