    "content": "Lectures . Students will initially follow a series of online, introductory lectures on the following topics: . | Introduction to Cell and Molecular Biology | Introduction to Genomics | Introduction to the NHS and Health Systems | . Presentation Task . Themes . Following this, the cohort will split into two groups and each will focus on a biological topic: . | Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) . | What is a “single nucleotide polymorphism”? What other types of genetic variant exist? | What is a “phenotype”? How does this relate to electronic health (medical) records? | What is a genetic association study? | How can a PheWAS be used to determine the potential genetic underpinning of human disease? What are the advantages over a conventional genetic association study? | . | Single cell ‘omics . | What are the advantages of single cell biology over measurements taken over a group of cells? | What types of measurements can be taken on individual cells? How do they differ in terms of what they tell us about the biology of the cell? | What biological processes or systems can be better explored using single cell techniques? | What are the challenges of working with single cells? | . | . Aims and Expectations . The aim is for each group to research and develop an oral presentation on your allocated topic describing: . | the key biological concepts, | example biological experiments and | the mechanisms underlying the data generated and how these data can be analysed to give insights. | . These presentations should be introductory in style. You are aiming to teach the other group about your topic. We are not expecting these presentations to be expert talks. Many terms and ideas will be unfamiliar to you. You do not need to understand everything only enough to create an interesting but factual presentation. This exercise principally concerns the biology so there is no need to investigate or research the details of the data analytics associated with these topics. No data analysis or computational work is required. What you need to do . Each presentation will be 40 minutes long and each member of your group will speak for at least 10 minutes. You will need to produce slides for your presentation. You can search for and identify source materials to learn about these topics (some suggestions given below) that range from the very elementary to cutting edge research articles. Initially, your group should discuss and understand each others underpinning knowledge on your allocated topic (if any exists at all). You will then need to determine the sub-themes you wish to discuss in your presentation (suggestions are given above) and allocate tasks for individuals to research and write presentation materials on these sub-themes. ** Group Organisation ** . You will be working to learn and absorb new information and material rapidly. Recognise that each group member will have a different academic background and that you will all have something new to learn but it will not necessarily be on the same topic. Share any knowledge you have and don’t be afraid to speak out if there is something you are unfamiliar with. It is important that within your group you ensure that all members of the group remain engaged and actively contribute. ",

    "title": "HDRUK-Turing Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science",
    "content": "“This PhD programme is a big step forward in our ambition to meet the UK’s need for trained health data scientists.” – Professor Peter Diggle, Programme Director . “Embedding our PhD students within an extensive cross-sector, multi-disciplinary collaborative network will enable them to address the greatest challenges in implementing health data science at scale.” – Professor Christopher Yau, Programme Co-Director . We are excited to welcome you to the start of your doctoral studies with us at Health Data Research UK in partnership with the Alan Turing Institute. This partnership brings to the Programme the combined expertise of two national institutes: Health Data Research UK (Health Data Science) and The Alan Turing Institute (Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). It is funded by the Wellcome Trust and champions their principles of scientific excellence and changing research culture for the better. In addition to our roles as Programme Director and Co-Director, we hold academic posts at Lancaster University (Peter) and at the University of Manchester (Chris) and are looking forward to being involved in the delivery, as well as the leadership, of this PhD Programme. We are ably assisted in both of these roles by an Executive Committee that includes at least one academic lead from each of the seven universities at which students on the Programme can initially register for their doctoral studies - Queen’s Belfast, Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford, University College London. Each of you is both a member of the HDRUK/Turing Wellcome PhD Programme and a research student at your university. What this will mean in practice is somthing we will discover together in the months ahead. My hope and expectation is that each of you will benefit from being a member of two distinct but overlapping cohorts. Over the four years of your studies you will spend progressively less time on Programme-wide activities and correspondingly more time working in your respective universities on your thesis projects. You will spend most of your first year engaging in Programme-organised activities. As well as sharpening and adding to your personal took-kit, these will give you opportunities to meet (if only virtually in the early months) and share ideas with your fellow-students and potential thesis co-supervisors from around the UK. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this. Fundamental to Chris’s and my philosophy is that the best health data science is team science, with team members spanning multiple disciplines. We expect this to be reflected in the supervisory teams for your thesis projects and to encourage this you will be able to visit, and be co-supervised by, researchers in other universities to give you the best possible supervisory team for your thesis work. Your university will also be organising activities for you during your first year, the nature of which will vary across the seven universites. In your second, third and fourth years, we will continue to organise Programme-based training events, including student-led events, but the schedule of events will be much less intensive than in your first year, as you will spend the bulk of your time on your thesis project .

We will discuss your engagement and contribution to the Year One Training Programme (via your Evidence-based Training Record) and the contents of your proposed research plan for Years 2-4. The outcome will be one of the following (note that all interview outcomes are conditional on home university requirements also being fulfilled): . | Approved: the student may progress to Year 2 of the PhD programme. | Request for Revision: the student has engaged well with the training programme but is required to revise their PhD research plan and resubmit for review. | Request for New Research Plan: the student has engaged well with the training programme but is required to devise a new PhD research plan and resubmit for review. | Cause for Concern: the interview panel has identified issues related to your engagement with the PhD programme and will advise a further consultation with yourself and your home university to determine the next steps. | . Cause for concern may arise due to factors such as unexplained or unauthorised absence, failure to participate in training activities, poor conduct when engaging with other students or staff.

During this course we will consider the different phases of generic “design process” theory and how they can be applied in health data science. The aim is to provide new ideas that will help to maximise your creativity during your PhD but also boost your critical evaluation skills to enable you to recognise how to judge “good” from “bad” solutions.

Some students will have extensive prior experience in some areas, but maybe little to none in others. The Common Core is intended to help students to identify their personal needs for training and development. During the first year, students will continually update an evidence-based training record where they will map the activities contained in the various training courses to the Common Core. The intention is for each student to reflect on the training provided and to understand how their experiences align with the Common Core. This is not intended to be a “tick box” exercise.
